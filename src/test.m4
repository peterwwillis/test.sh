### How to use test.sh:
### 
###  1. Create some shell scripts in tests/ directory, filename ending with '.t'
###  2. Define some functions ('_t_NAME') in that shell script
###     a. Put the space-separated NAMEs in global variable $ext_tests
###     b. Register test pass/fail with 'return 0' / 'return 1'
###  3. Run `./test.sh tests/*.t`
